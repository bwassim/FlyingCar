# FCND - 3D Motion Planning - Project 2

###  Explain what's going on in  `motion_planning.py` and `planning_utils.py`

I will explain step by step how the backyard flyer code works :

The structure of the code of the motion planning is different from that of the backyard flyer in the following points:
1. We have an additional `flight_state` consisting of the `PLANNING` state
2. Therefore we added the condition on this new state in the state_callback function
3. The waypoints does not constitute a box anymore. The path constructed using the A* algorithm is converted to actual waypoints. 
4. The other functions remains the same 
5. Plan_path is the function where most of the work will be done, since the main goal of this exercice is to find a way to go from point A to point B while avoiding obstacles. This is done through generating a path and then, as mentioned before, generate the minimum number of waypoint for the drone to follow. 
6. After creating the grid and defining the offsets we use the A* algorithm to generate the waypoints that we send to the autopilot
### Step 7: Write your planner

Your planning algorithm is going to look something like the following:

- Load the 2.5D map in the `colliders.csv` file describing the environment.
- Discretize the environment into a grid or graph representation.
- Define the start and goal locations. You can determine your home location from `self._latitude` and `self._longitude`. 
- Perform a search using A* or other search algorithm. 
- Use a collinearity test or ray tracing method (like Bresenham) to remove unnecessary waypoints.
- Return waypoints in local ECEF coordinates (format for `self.all_waypoints` is [N, E, altitude, heading], where the droneâ€™s start location corresponds to [0, 0, 0, 0]). 

Some of these steps are already implemented for you and some you need to modify or implement yourself.  See the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) for specifics on what you need to modify or implement.

### Step 8: Write it up!
When you're finished, complete a detailed writeup of your solution and discuss how you addressed each step. You can use the [`writeup_template.md`](./writeup_template.md) provided here or choose a different format, just be sure to describe clearly the steps you took and code you used to address each point in the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view). And have fun!

## Extra Challenges
The submission requirements for this project are laid out in the rubric, but if you feel inspired to take your project above and beyond, or maybe even keep working on it after you submit, then here are some suggestions for interesting things to try.

### Try flying more complex trajectories
In this project, things are set up nicely to fly right-angled trajectories, where you ascend to a particular altitude, fly a path at that fixed altitude, then land vertically. However, you have the capability to send 3D waypoints and in principle you could fly any trajectory you like. Rather than simply setting a target altitude, try sending altitude with each waypoint and set your goal location on top of a building!

### Adjust your deadbands
Adjust the size of the deadbands around your waypoints, and even try making deadbands a function of velocity. To do this, you can simply modify the logic in the `local_position_callback()` function.

### Add heading commands to your waypoints
This is a recent update! Make sure you have the [latest version of the simulator](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Simulator-Releases/releases). In the default setup, you're sending waypoints made up of NED position and heading with heading set to 0 in the default setup. Try passing a unique heading with each waypoint. If, for example, you want to send a heading to point to the next waypoint, it might look like this:

```python
# Define two waypoints with heading = 0 for both
wp1 = [n1, e1, a1, 0]
wp2 = [n2, e2, a2, 0]
# Set heading of wp2 based on relative position to wp1
wp2[3] = np.arctan2((wp2[1]-wp1[1]), (wp2[0]-wp1[0]))
```

This may not be completely intuitive, but this will yield a yaw angle that is positive counterclockwise about a z-axis (down) axis that points downward.

Put all of these together and make up your own crazy paths to fly! Can you fly a double helix??

Ok flying a double helix might seem like a silly idea, but imagine you are an autonomous first responder vehicle. You need to first fly to a particular building or location, then fly a reconnaissance pattern to survey the scene! Give it a try!
